### UI Refresh
- Moved many UI elements to a three-state "checkbox", which will hopefully improve clarity
- Simplified some labels
- Removed an unnecessary level of layout nesting

### Other

<!-- - Proxy keyframe validation fixed and re-enabled -->
- Validator now correctly checks for maximum *triangles*, rather than faces
- Adjustments for easier scripting of import/export
